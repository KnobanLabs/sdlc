# Init: the repository's files

What `/sdlc:init` writes, itself or through the Release Engineer (`SKILL.md`,
section 5, step 4): the governance, docs, agent,
GitHub, and editor files. The CI, hooks, and automation are in
`workflows.md`. Write only what the answers in `setup.md` call for, in the
voice below: plain, specific, and explaining why where it isn't obvious.

## Placeholders

| Placeholder | Value |
|---|---|
| `{{name}}` | The display name ("Recipe Box") |
| `{{repo}}` | `owner/repo` |
| `{{url}}` | `https://github.com/{{repo}}` |
| `{{branch}}` | The default branch; `develop` unless the answers say otherwise. Wherever a file below says `develop`, use it |
| `{{holder}}` | The copyright holder: the company's legal name, or the individual's full name |
| `{{year}}` | The current year |
| `{{handle}}` | The human's GitHub login |
| `{{pitch}}` | The brief's one-paragraph description |
| `{{areas}}` | The area labels: `ci`, `config`, `documentation`, `infra`, and the project's own |

`TODO(init)` marks what the brief can't fill yet, such as the dev commands
before a stack exists. The seeding job turns each one into a ticket.

## Copyright header

Every config, workflow, and script file that takes comments starts with the
header, in its comment syntax, followed by a blank line: YAML (issue forms
included), shell, and dotfiles such as `.gitignore`. Markdown and JSON take
none.

- **Proprietary:**

  ```
  # Copyright {{year}} {{holder}}. All rights reserved.
  # ({{url}})
  ```

- **Open source:**

  ```
  # Copyright {{year}} {{holder}}
  # SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX id, such as MIT>
  # ({{url}})
  ```

`AGENTS.md`'s Copyright header convention states the same form.

## Layout

| Path | Written when |
|---|---|
| `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE`, `AUTHORS` | Always |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Copilot is one of the agents |
| `.agents/skills/.gitkeep` | Always |
| `.mcp.json` | The brief has a user interface |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/labels.json` | Always |
| `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `.vscode/extensions.json`, `.vscode/settings.json` | Always |
| `docs/adr/README.md`, `docs/adr/0000-template.md` | Always |
| Everything in `workflows.md` | As it says |

**Adopting** an existing repository, write a file only where the plan says to.
Merge into what's there (a section added to an existing `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a
line added to `.gitignore`) rather than replacing it, and match the file's
existing voice.

## README.md

```markdown

## Getting Started

TODO(init): Prerequisites, and the commands that set up, run and test the
project.

Turn on the secret scan before your first commit (it needs Docker):

    scripts/install-hooks.sh

## Contributing

<By invitation: "Contributions are by invitation." Open: "Contributions are
welcome."> See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the branch, commit and
pull request conventions, and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the instructions
coding agents follow.

## Security

Report vulnerabilities privately, as [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) describes.

## License

Use a fenced block for the hook command.

## AGENTS.md

`CLAUDE.md` is the single line `@AGENTS.md`. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Instructions — {{name}}

All agent instructions live in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) at the repository root
— read and follow it. It covers the project overview, dev commands, agent
skills, code conventions, and what to avoid.

Do not duplicate instructions here; update `AGENTS.md` instead.
```

`AGENTS.md`, starting `# {{name}} — Agent Instructions` and the paragraph
"This is the canonical instruction set for all coding agents (Claude Code,
GitHub Copilot, and others). `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
defer to this file — make instruction changes here only." Then:

- **Project Overview:** what it is, who uses it, where it runs, and its state
  (a new project), from the brief. Link `docs/adr/`.
- **Dev Commands:** `TODO(init)`, and the fenced line
  `scripts/install-hooks.sh   # turn on the pre-commit secret scan (needs Docker)`.
- **Agent Skills:** domain instructions live in `.agents/skills/`, one folder
  per skill with a `SKILL.md`; read the relevant one before working in that
  area, and add one when an area outgrows this file. An empty table with the
  columns Skill and When to use.
- **Key Conventions**, as bullets:
  - **Never commit to `develop`:** it is the protected default branch; every
    change goes on a feature branch through a pull request, never pushed or
    force-pushed directly, even for a typo.
  - **Branches** are named `<handle>/<issue#>-<type>-<short-description>`, with
    `none` when there is no issue (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, _Branch Naming_).
  - **Commits and pull request titles** follow Conventional Commits, in the
    imperative and lower case (`fix: stop the retry loop on a 404`). CI rejects
    a title that doesn't conform, and the title becomes the squashed commit on
    `develop` and its changelog line.
  - **Pull requests** fill out every section of the template, replacing each
    `None` that applies and keeping the guidance comments, and list the issues
    they close (`Closes #123`).
  - **CI green and every review thread resolved** before a merge, through the
    merge queue (or auto-merge without one; with no ruleset, merging by hand
    once the checks are green). When a job fails for a reason the
    change can't explain, rerun only the failed jobs, once; a second failure is
    real.
  - **An issue you file or triage gets all four triage fields:** its type, a
    Priority, an Effort, and at least one area label (`CONTRIBUTING.md`,
    _Triaging Issues_).
  - **Architecture decisions are recorded** in `docs/adr/`: read the relevant
    record before changing what it decided. A _Proposed_ record may be edited;
    an _Accepted_ one changes only through a new record that supersedes it.
  - **No new abstractions** beyond what the immediate task requires.
  - **Comments** explain _why_, not _what_, and only where it is non-obvious.
  - **Pin what CI runs:** Actions by commit SHA with the version in a comment,
    images by digest. <Renovate or Dependabot> moves them.
  - **No AI self-attribution** in commits, PRs, issues, or discussions: no
    `Co-Authored-By` model trailers, "Generated with …" footers, or similar.
  - **Copyright header:** every config, workflow, and script file that takes
    comments starts with the header (above), in that file type's comment
    syntax.
- **What to Avoid**, as bullets: committing secrets, tokens, keys, or real
  credentials, even in examples or tests (the hook and CI scan; an
  `.env.example` holds placeholders only); error handling for scenarios that
  can't happen where the code runs; backwards-compatibility shims, data
  migrations, or legacy fallbacks for code being changed, unless an accepted
  record requires one; a new kind of service, cloud product, or vendor that no
  record covers (propose it in a record first); and a workflow with more
  permissions than its job needs (`permissions: {}` at the top, and each job
  asking for what it uses, with a comment saying why).

## CONTRIBUTING.md

`# Contributing to {{name}}`, then an opening that follows the license and
contribution answers. By invitation and proprietary: "{{name}} is a private,
proprietary project (see LICENSE). Contributions are by invitation, and
outside contributions need a written agreement with {{holder}} first."
Open: thank contributors and say how to start (an issue first for anything
large). Then a note for coding agents: `AGENTS.md` is canonical, with
domain detail in `.agents/skills/`, and this guide is the human-facing summary.
Then these sections:

- **Prerequisites:** Git 2.36 or newer; Docker, for the pre-commit secret scan;
  the GitHub CLI, signed in. `TODO(init)`: the toolchain and the versions it
  pins.
- **Development Setup:** `TODO(init)`. Then **Secret scan before each commit**:
  the hook scans what a commit stages with the same Trivy image and config
  (`.github/trivy-secret.yaml`) as CI's _Scan for secrets_ step, so a secret is
  stopped before it's committed rather than after it's pushed; turn it on once
  per clone with `scripts/install-hooks.sh`. It copies the staged files to a
  temporary folder inside `.git`, always removed, and runs Trivy with no
  network over the read-only folder. It fails when Docker isn't running rather
  than letting the commit through. `SKIP_SECRET_SCAN=1 git commit …` or
  `--no-verify` skips it, and CI still scans the push; `pre-merge-commit` scans
  git's own merges. Give the whole-tree command, the same `docker run` as
  validate.yaml's step (`workflows.md`), with `/repo` mounted read-only.
- **Branch Naming:** `<handle>/<issue#>-<type>-<short-description>`, with
  examples (`{{handle}}/41-feat-export-csv`, `{{handle}}/none-chore-tidy-gitignore`),
  `none` without an issue, and the types `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`,
  `test`, `ci`, and `chore`.
- **Commit Messages:** Conventional Commits, `<type>(<scope>): <short
  description>` with an optional body and footer, and three examples. PR
  titles follow it too, and CI rejects those that don't. A pull request
  squashes to one commit titled by it. With releases: release-please builds
  the changelog and version from those titles, `feat` bumping the minor, `fix`
  the patch, and `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer the major.
- **Pull Request Process:** `develop` is protected, so every change lands
  through a pull request. Numbered steps:
  1. Branch from `develop`.
  2. Make the change with every check passing.
  3. Fill out the template, replacing each `None` that applies and keeping the
     comments.
  4. Add before and after screenshots for any UI change.
  5. Open the PR against `develop`; CODEOWNERS requests the reviewers.
  6. Get CI green and resolve every thread. A Copilot code review is welcome
     but optional.
  7. Merge.

  `~PR Preparation` lints the title and labels the PR by its paths, keeping
  the labels in step with the diff, so don't add area labels the paths don't
  explain. The rerun rule: **Re-run failed jobs**, or
  `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`, once, never **Re-run all jobs**. A job
  that passes on the rerun has a flaky test: open a bug, or add to the one
  open. A second failure is real. First-time contributors may add themselves
  to `AUTHORS`.
- **Merging:** with the merge queue, **Merge when ready** or
  `gh pr merge <number>` queues a green PR. The queue squashes it onto the
  latest `develop` with the PRs ahead of it, and runs `Validate Branch` again.
  A failure drops the PR from the queue; fix the branch and queue it again,
  since rerunning the failed run doesn't. The branch needn't be up to date. The
  required checks are `validation-outcome` and `pr-lint-title`, and a new job
  joins them through `validation-outcome`'s `needs`, never the ruleset.
  Without the queue: `gh pr merge <number> --squash --auto`, which merges once
  the same checks pass. Without a ruleset, nothing is required, so auto-merge
  would merge at once: say instead to wait for green checks, then
  `gh pr merge <number> --squash`.
- **Runners:** CI runs on GitHub's hosted runners. Each job that can move
  reads `RUNNER_LINUX` (`gh variable set RUNNER_LINUX --body <label>`; delete it
  to go back), taking `ubuntu-24.04` when unset, and a queued job keeps the
  runner it asked for. `~Release Please`, `Renovate`, and `~PR Preparation`
  always stay on GitHub's runners, because each holds a token that can write.
  A public repository never uses self-hosted runners, since fork pull requests
  would run on them.
- **Releasing** (with releases): release-please keeps a release PR,
  `chore: release vX.Y.Z`, open on `develop` with the changelog. Merging it,
  through the usual flow, tags `vX.Y.Z` and publishes the release, and the
  `v*` tags are protected. It runs as the release App, so the release PR's
  checks start on their own. The App needs contents, issues, and pull requests
  write, and its `RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
  repository secrets; until both are set, the workflow passes with a warning.
  "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" stays off.
  `TODO(init)`: what a release deploys, if anything.
- **Dependency updates:** Renovate: it runs in the `Renovate` workflow, as a
  second App kept apart from the release one (contents, pull requests, issues,
  workflows, and commit statuses write, metadata read, no webhook). Its
  secrets belong to the `renovate` environment, whose only deployment branch
  is `develop`, so a run from any other branch gets neither. Its global config
  runs none of the repository's code. It runs Mondays at 01:17 UTC, inside the
  00:00 to 06:00 UTC window, and every update waits 7 days. Give
  `gh workflow run renovate.yaml`, with `-f dry-run=true` for a dry run. Add
  each ecosystem to `enabledManagers`. Dependabot instead: it opens grouped
  weekly PRs from `.github/dependabot.yml`, each update waiting 7 days, and the
  images pinned in workflows and the hook are moved by hand. Either way,
  security updates are Dependabot's.
- **Reporting Issues:** the Bug, Feature, and Task forms, and security reports
  through `SECURITY.md`, never an issue. Reporters needn't set priority,
  effort, or area.
- **Triaging Issues:** a maintainer, or an agent working for one, gives each
  new issue a type (Bug, Feature, or Task), a Priority (Urgent blocks the
  current milestone or is broken; High is next up; Medium is planned; Low is
  someday), an Effort, and at least one area label from `{{areas}}`, then
  removes `triage`. A new area goes in `.github/labels.json`,
  `.github/labeler.yaml`, `AREA_LABELS` in `scripts/triage-fields.sh`, and the
  board's Area field. Say where Priority and Effort are set (issue fields, or
  the board). Effort:
  - **Low:** a contained change, a few hours to a day (about 200 hand-written
    lines or fewer).
  - **Medium:** one area over a day to a few days (about 200 to 1,000 lines), or
    a decision or document that needs research.
  - **High:** a week or more, several areas or a new subsystem (over 1,000
    lines), or an epic.

  When refining changes an issue's scope, set its Effort again. With the triage
  check, describe it: the `Triage Fields` workflow labels each open issue
  missing a field `triage` every day, and nothing more. Give
  `gh workflow run triage-fields.yaml` and
  `GH_REPO={{repo}} scripts/triage-fields.sh --dry-run`.
- **The Project board** (with a board): the Status options with their meanings
  (`github-setup.md`, section 8), that the board's workflows move an item to
  In Review when a PR links to it and to Done when it closes, and the four
  views.

Leave out the sections and sentences for what the answers turned off.

## SECURITY.md

```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release receives security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.** <The chosen
channel: "Report them privately through GitHub's [private vulnerability
reporting]({{url}}/security/advisories/new) (the repository's **Security** tab,
**Report a vulnerability**).", "Email <address>.", or "Contact the maintainer
privately via their [GitHub profile](https://github.com/{{handle}})."> 

Include as much detail as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Any suggested mitigations

You can expect an acknowledgement within 72 hours and a resolution timeline
within 14 days for confirmed issues.

## Patching

A critical advisory in a dependency is patched within 72 hours of reaching the
maintainer. Dependabot alerts report each one, and its security update pull
requests carry the fix where one is published.

## Secrets

Secret scanning and push protection are on for the repository, and the
pre-commit hook and CI scan every change with Trivy (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, _Secret
scan before each commit_). A secret that reaches a commit is treated as leaked:
revoke and replace it first, then remove it from the history.

## Threat Model

TODO(init): What the project runs, who can reach it, what it trusts, and what
it stores. Then what is in scope, and what is out of scope by design.

### In scope

- TODO(init)

### Out of scope (by design)

- TODO(init)
```

Without secret scanning (`github-setup.md`, section 1), the Secrets section
says only the hook and CI scan.

**`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:**

```markdown
<!-- Be sure your PR title follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.

Your PR title should use [imperative mood](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?h=v2.36.1#n181) as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior. The title should be present tense. Avoid the use of capitalization, unless you are referencing a proper noun.

Here are some examples of good PR titles:
- feat: change the whitelist skipper function in the middleware to use regex
- fix: insert missing await on audio device list
- chore: move the runners to ubuntu-24.04

For each section below, if there's content to add, replace the description `None`. -->

## Description

<!-- Replace this with a description of what this PR is changing or adding, and why. If you've changed UI, include screenshots/video of the new UI.* -->

None

## Issues

<!-- List all of the issues this PR fixes. Use a bulleted list like:
- Closes #101
- Closes #103
-->

None

## Type of Change

<!-- Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply, do not delete the others: -->

- [ ] ❌ `!` -- Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing
      functionality to change)
- [ ] ✨ `feat` -- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] 🛠️ `fix` -- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] 📝 `docs` -- Additional or updated documentation
- [ ] 🎨 `style` -- Code style changes (formatting, missing semi colons, etc)
- [ ] 🧹 `refactor` -- Code refactor
- [ ] ⚡ `perf` -- Performance improvement
- [ ] 🧪 `test` -- Tests (adding or updating tests)
- [ ] 🏗️ `build` -- Build system or external dependencies changes
- [ ] ✅ `ci` -- Build configuration change
- [ ] 🗑️ `chore` -- Grunt tasks
- [ ] ⏪ `revert` -- Revert previous changes
```

## Agents and editor

**`.mcp.json`** (a user interface only):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@<latest version, pinned>"]
    }
  }
}
```

**`.editorconfig`:** `root = true`; for `[*]`, utf-8, `lf`, spaces, an indent
of 2, a final newline, and trimmed trailing whitespace; `[*.md]` keeps
trailing whitespace; `[Makefile]` uses tabs.

**`.gitattributes`:** `* text=auto`; `text` for css, go, html, java, js, json,
md, py, sh, ts, txt, xml, yaml, and yml; `text eol=crlf` for bat, cmd, ps1,
and sln; `binary` for gif, gpg, ico, jar, jpg, pdf, png, webp, and zip; and,
with releases, `CHANGELOG.md linguist-generated`, since release-please writes
it. Add the stack's own extensions.

**`.gitignore`:** with a comment per group: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.pem`,
`*.key`, `*.log`; editors (`.idea/`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/*` except
`extensions.json` and `settings.json`); env files (`.env*` except
`.env.example`, which holds placeholders only); agents' local settings
(`.claude/settings.local.json`). Then the stack's build output, dependencies,
and caches, or `TODO(init)` without a stack.

**`.vscode/extensions.json`:** EditorConfig.EditorConfig,
github.vscode-github-actions, redhat.vscode-yaml, timonwong.shellcheck,
streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker. **`.vscode/settings.json`:** a ruler at
80, `\n` line endings, a final newline, trimmed trailing whitespace except in
Markdown, Markdown wrapped at column 80, and `redhat.telemetry.enabled: false`.

## docs/adr

`README.md`: "Architecture decision records". Each record explains one
decision: the problem, the options weighed, what was chosen and why, and what
follows. Read the record before changing what it decided, and write a new one
to change it. Then an empty index table (Number, Title, Status), and
**Writing one**:

- **Name:** `NNNN-short-title.md`, numbered from `0001` and never reused, started
  from `0000-template.md`, with a row added to the index.
- **Sections:** status, context, the options weighed, the decision with its
  reasons, the consequences, and the ticket it came from.
- **Status:** _Proposed_ in review, _Accepted_ once the owner accepts it, and
  _Superseded by NNNN_ when replaced. A partial replacement names the part
  replaced.
- **Change:** never rewrite an accepted decision; supersede it. Typo, link, and
  ticket fixes are fine.
- **Ship it** with the pull request it describes, or before the work that
  relies on it.
- **Leave out** prices, secrets, credentials, personal details, and exploit
  detail.

`0000-template.md`: `# NNNN. Title of the decision`, the Status (Proposed),
Date, and Ticket bullets, then Context, Options (Option A and B, each with
what it costs and gives), Decision, and Consequences, each with a one-line
prompt.
